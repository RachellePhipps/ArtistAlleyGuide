### How can I utilize this site?
This website allows users to search for a convention by name, date, and number of attendees. Clicking on a convention will take the user to a special page for that convention detailing its location, about the convention itself, how to apply, and more. Logged-in users are able to leave comments and ratings on conventions they have attended as well as favorite conventions for later.
